Always keep a copy of the original main-routes.route or you can always get an
  updated working version at
  https://github.com/tatsh/sutra/blob/master/site/routes/main-routes.route
If you want your own class to handle the homepage, edit main-routes.route's / line.

Add your own .route file, such as mysite.route.

Syntax is:
/url = className::method
/url2 = globalfunctionName
/url3/:user_id(\d+) = userClass::handleUser

The method can be instance or static. All URLs begin with /.

In the /url3 example, the method will only be called if the regular expression
  matches. $_GET['user_id'] would exist and would be the value. You should
  use fRequest::get('user_id', 'int').

If you encounter an issue with a particular regular expression, please file an
  issue. https://github.com/tatsh/sutra/issues
